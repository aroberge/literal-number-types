# Python-ideas Summaries

In this repository, I make an attempt at summarizing various recurring discussions on the [Python-ideas list](https://mail.python.org/archives/list/python-ideas@python.org/).

For some of these discussions, I might attempt to create some sample code (module or import hook) that would implement the ideas discussed.

Anyone should feel free to contribute either sample code that implements and illustrates a given proposal, or offer corrections to my interpretation of the historical record.

Unless stated otherwise in a given file, anyone should feel free to adopt any information found here, including code samples, without needing to give attribution to this repository.
